# heart-disease-prediction-using-ML-algorithms
 I have developed a machine learning-based solution to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. I have implemented five different algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and a hybrid model combining Random Forest and  Logistic Regression models.
